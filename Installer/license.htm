    <p><span style="color:#4B4B4B"><b>Activities that destroy game balance</b></span><br />
    <span style="margin-left:14pt; color:#4B4B4B">Using third party programs or tools in
    FINAL FANTASY XIV is strictly prohibited since they allow users to gain an unfair
    advantage over other players. The use of programs or tools within FINAL FANTASY XIV
    that allow certain continuous actions to be performed automatically are often
    referred to as absentee play, which is also prohibited in FINAL FANTASY XIV.
    Additionally, during the course of an absentee play investigation, players may be
    requested to respond to or comply with a GMs instruction. Failure to&nbsp; do so is
    consider a violation and may result in&nbsp; disciplinary action being taken against
    the account.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-left:14pt; color:#4B4B4B">The following activities are also
    prohibited in FINAL FANTASY XIV.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:21pt; color:#4B4B4B">&bull; Modifying, analyzing, integrating
    and reverse engineering game data<br />    
    &bull; Utility creation and distribution<br />

    <span style="color:#4B4B4B">These types of suspension are usually issued
    to players committing the least severe service violations. Please note, after
    receiving a 24 hour suspension, your next violation will result in receiving a 72
    hour suspension regardless of the type of violation committed.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#4B4B4B"><b>48 Hour Minimum Suspension</b></span><br />
    <span style="color:#4B4B4B">This is the least common suspension type.
    These types of suspension are usually reserved for special case violations that
    don&rsquo;t fit within the confines of a 24 or 72 hour suspension.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#4B4B4B"><b>72 Hour Minimum Suspension</b></span><br />
    <span style="color:#4B4B4B">These types of suspension are usually issued
    to players committing the most severe policy violations. Additionally, accounts that
    are dealt a 72 hour suspension will be investigated and considered for termination.
    In these cases, the suspension remains in place until the completion of the
    investigation, even if this exceeds the 72-hour period.</span></p>
